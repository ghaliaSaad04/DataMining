# IT326 DataMining Project 
## Project Title: Traffic Accident Severity Prediction Based on Environmental and Traffic Factors
**Project Motivation:** Traffic accidents are a critical public safety issue, leading to significant loss of life and economic consequences. 
Understanding the factors that influence accident severity is essential for improving road safety and emergency response strategies. 
This dataset provides valuable insights into how environmental and traffic conditions impact accident outcomes. 
By analyzing these patterns and building predictive models, we aim to contribute to smarter transportation systems and help reduce the severity and impact of road accidents.
