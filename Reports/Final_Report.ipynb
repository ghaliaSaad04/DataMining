    "Recently, traffic accidents have become more frequent and severe, causing serious harm to people’s lives and leading to injuries, deaths, and major economic losses. This growing issue highlights the importance of understanding the reasons behind the severity of accidents. In our project, we will study and analyze traffic accident data, focusing on environmental and traffic-related factors, to identify patterns that affect the level of accident severity. This will help in predicting whether an accident is likely to be low, moderate, or high in severity, and will support efforts to improve road safety, emergency response, and help reduce the overall impact of traffic accidents.\n",

    "In our project, we will use two data mining tasks to help us predict the severity level of traffic accidents, which are classification and clustering. For classification, we will train our model to classify whether an accident is low, moderate, or high in severity using the Accident_Severity class based on a set of environmental and traffic-related factors such as weather conditions, visibility, road surface, and light conditions. For clustering, our model will group together accidents with similar characteristics into clusters. These clusters will help us better understand common patterns among different types of accidents and will be used to support the prediction of severity for new accident cases."
